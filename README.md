Link to live site: https://perrenial.herokuapp.com/

Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, MongoDb, Mongoose, Heroku, Bootstrap, Express, Express-Sessions, Method-Override, Bcrypt, Dotenv.

About the app:

I created a design for an online plant shop using the 7 Restful Routes. Users are able to add plants with descriptions, edit and delete them. I also used bcrypt and express-sessions to create a login/logout function. In the future I would like to make the site more dynamic by adding a proper shopping cart and favorites page to make the site more functional and like a real online store.

Unsolved Problems:

I ran into issues when I tried to make a separate home page so I had to keep the site simple for now. I'd like to go back and edit these problems I encountered once I learn more skills so I can make the site how I had originally envisioned.
